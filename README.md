This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Currently it only works with YouTube Music. You will need to install this Tampermonkey script to export the current playing song data to the app: https://gitlab.com/Arno500/WebKaraoke/-/raw/main/tampermonkey.js?ref_type=heads&inline=false
